# Video Car Counter with YOLOv8

A Python program that uses the YOLOv8 model to detect, track, and count cars crossing a virtual line in a video. This project was developed as a practical study in Computer Vision.

## Demo


## Features
- Real-time object detection from a video file.
- Object tracking to assign a unique ID to each car.
- Object counting based on crossing a virtual line.
- Filtering detections by class

## Technologies Used
- Python 3
- OpenCV
- PyTorch
- Ultralytics (YOLOv8)

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository: `git clone [YOUR_REPO_URL]`
2. Create and activate a virtual environment.
3. Install the dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Run the script: `python main.py`
