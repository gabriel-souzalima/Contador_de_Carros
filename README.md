# Video Car Counter with YOLOv8

A Python program that uses the YOLOv8 model to detect, track, and count cars crossing a virtual line in a video. This project was developed as a practical study in Computer Vision.

## Demo


## Features
- Object detection from a video file.
- Object counting based on crossing a virtual line.
- Filtering detections by class
